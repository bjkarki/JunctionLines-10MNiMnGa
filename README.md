# Junction Lines - 10M Ni-Mn-Ga

Microstructural studies of $10M$ Ni-Mn-Ga have shown triple and quadruple line junctions (TLJ and QLJ, respectively). Here we implement the topological model of deformation twinning to characterize the defects of these TLJ and QLJ.

Characterization of these defects allow us to investigate their role in the difference in twin boundary kinetics between *type I* and *type II* twins.
